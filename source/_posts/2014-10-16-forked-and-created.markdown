I've gone ahead and [forked](https://github.com/coffee-ops/coffee) from [Mathias Meyer](https://github.com/roidrage) so we can start posting docs on different
recipes. It's a start, but hell every building starts with a single (well two) brick right?

If you have suggestions or recipes yourself please don't hesitate to put in a PR with it so we can get it merged in!
